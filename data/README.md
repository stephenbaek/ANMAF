# Synthetic Data Generator for ANMAF

Probably the biggest bottleneck for integrating deep learning solutions into the real-world research workflow is always the data annotation. In order to avoid having to annotate cells in neuronal images exhaustively, ANMAF uses synthetic data for training. To generate synthetic images, you would first need to manually produce tiles in `data/background/tiles` folder. You could use tools like ImageJ to crop and sample some "empty areas" in neuronal images (i.e. areas containing no cells within) and save them as `*.tif` files.

Once the tiles are prepared, you can run the following command in the command prompt/terminal to produce synthetic backgrounds:
```bash
python generate_data.py
```

By default, 300 synthetic backgrounds will be generated by randomly combining the tiles and the total of 1,000 synthetic images will be generated by superimposing cell images on top of randomly selected backgrounds from those synthetic backgrounds. If you would like to play with these numbers, you could pass `-b` argument to adjust the number of synthetic backgrounds to be generated and `-n` argument to adjust the number of synthetic images to be generated. For example, the following command creates 100 synthetic background and the total of 2,000 synthetic cell images thereby.
```bash
python generate_data.py -n 2000 -b 100
```
